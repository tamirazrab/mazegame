Great but so simple game, there are so many things to be done.
## Current Problems
* User have to reload everytime to load new level.
* Annoying pop up everytime user wins game.
* Static level difficulty, no change in it.
* No tracking of user wins so on basis of that complexity of level could be increased.
* Control movements are so annoying.

## Future Suggestions
* Tracking of user score, adding multiple complexity.
* Before game start user would be able to select complexity then game would decide based on user performance.
* Random colour changing when win instead of dropping them on ground.
* Including timer challenge.

and maybe a thing or more if I got tyme.
